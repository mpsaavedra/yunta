# Yunta - Enterprise Resource Planning


![](./docs/images/logo-wiki.png)


An [ERP][erp] system that uses a  ***microservices oriented*** architecture implemented using Docker containers. There are various services developed in different technologies, the tasks that lead you to the result are:

### Technologies we use

* .NET Core 2.2
* Entity Framework Core
* JWT Tokens
* Docker


>Note: This system is under a heavy development process, many of the propossed options are still under design and development.


## Architecture

All services are running inside Docker containers. [See architecture documentation](./docs/architecture.md). The main idea is to create an stable system that uses microservices in a transparent form, connecting each other using [BFF][bff] gateways that centralize the microservices access in a single point making easier and consistent the frontend development process.

It also includes other sub-projects that works around a core library and provides a centralized functionalities library. **Yunta** includes a set of T4 templates that generate WebAPI code from [POCO][poco] annotated objects in order to making easier the microservice development process. This also gives the possibility to enhace the services development speed by providing a base project structure to start the development process according to the **Yunta** standards.

## Manifesto


This software comes with a [manifesto](./docs/erp_manifesto.md) inspired in the **Debian GNU/Linux** manifesto in order to give things a little more of consistency to the written code and to define the objectives of this solution. Even when is not ***STRICTLY*** necesary to be follow is better if you read it to get a more general idea about what is this software about and why and where is heading to. We recomend you to read it.

## Intention

We do not have the intention to get rich with this software, at the begining it start just as a form to learn about [.NetCORE][netcore] mainly because many friend where talking about it and beacuse i was not satisfy with what other frameworks where giving, by now i think of it as a solution to many development needs a lot of developers -``mostly friends``- had. By using a centralized core and T4 templates we ensure that the code repetition could be reduced and with it the amount of spend time during development process.

## Whats Bimbo, Inc.

Well, you could read more about it in the [Manifesto](./docs/manifesto.md) file but you should know that **Bimbo, Inc** is an small group of developers gather in a simple group -``currently am the only developer **:D**, but hope to get some other contributors``- with the idea to provide a consistent and scalable platform for [SOHO][soho] companies, that requires god software solutions but with no to much budged, neither a professional development group.
